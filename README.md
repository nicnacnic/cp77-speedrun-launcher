# cp77-speedrun-launcher
A simple launcher with various quality-of-life features for Cyberpunk 2077 speedrunners.

## Installation
For a pre-compiled script, please download the latest release.

Drop the three files into your root CP77 directory. Should replace the RED Launcher.

This launcher is built using AutoHotkey, you shouldn't need the main AHK program to use this script.

## Configuration
Configuration instructions are in the launcher itself.

To get rid of the launcher just verify Steam files.

## Compatibility
Works with all PC versions of CP77. Tested with Steam, untested with GOG but should work.

## Feature Requests
Please reach out to me on Discord (nicnacnc#5683).
