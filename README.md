# cp77-speedrun-launcher
A simple launcher with various quality-of-life features for Cyberpunk 2077 speedrunners.

## Installation
Drop the three files into your root CP77 directory. Should replace the RED Launcher.

## Configuration
Configuration instructions are in the launcher itself.
To get rid of the launcher just verify Steam files.

## Compatibility
Works with all PC versions of CP77. Tested with Steam, untested with GOG but should work.
